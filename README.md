Mr. Ho Nguyen Chinh Tam
Senior Project Manager
Global Cybersoft â€“ A Hitachi consulting company
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

Dear Mr. Ho Nguyen Chinh Tam

I am writing this letter to provide you with my formal notice of resignation from Global Cybersoft. This was not an easy decision to make, and I appreciate your support over the past time.  I truly value the experience, training, and knowledge I gained from you. However, after 1 week of probation, I realize that this is not the right time for me to work since I have a lot of things to complete at university. So that is the main reason that made me make the decision.
Please let me know what I can help to ease the process. I wish you all the best as Global Cybersoft will be more successful and greater.

Thank you very much for everything.

Best,
Le Dinh Quang
